For each set of results, I will include:
- raw data: data that can be extracted using the python functions I provide.
- readable data: a csv format of the data summaries (percentile, average, mean error, etc...)
- graph data: graph representation of the readable data

I will also try to make the ipython notebook very readible and comment what each function does.
